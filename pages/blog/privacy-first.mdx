# Privacy first

Privacy first means privacy by default. This website uses SimpleAnalytics as a Google Analytics
alternative. They share the same position as we do regarding privacy.

## Data Logging and Retention

### Are IP Address Hashes Personal Data Under GDPR?

IP address hashing converts a user's IP address into an encrypted string of characters, making it
unrecognizable while still allowing basic analytics functionality. While this technique appears more
privacy-friendly than storing raw IP addresses, its legal status under GDPR requires careful
examination.

### Understanding IP Hashing and Personal Data

Under Article 4(1) of the GDPR, personal data includes "any information relating to an identified or
identifiable natural person." This definition encompasses both direct and indirect means of
identification, including online identifiers and location data. IP address hashes, even when stored
temporarily (e.g., for 24 hours), can still function as unique identifiers that single out
individual users. When combined with other technical data points such as:

- Device specifications
- Browser settings
- Time zone information
- Language preferences

This creates a unique digital fingerprint that can identify specific users, bringing it within
GDPR's scope of personal data processing.
