## ✞ dogma

We put `end-user usability` at the heart of everything we do – no compromises.

- Prioritize towards `end-user usability`.
- Complexity is less an issue than `inconsistency in an environment`.
- Building `better systems` not 'better' goals.
- Improving Ethereum's consensus stability and censorship resistance against wealthy and state-level
  actors.
