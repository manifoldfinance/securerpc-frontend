# Understanding Service Availability Metrics

## Time-Based Availability

Time-based availability is traditionally calculated using the formula:

```math
Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)
```

While this formula seems straightforward, it presents several challenges for modern distributed systems:

1. **Defining Uptime**
   - In a globally distributed service, "uptime" becomes ambiguous
   - The service might be up in one region but down in another
   - Partial system failures can create states that are neither fully up nor down
   - Different components might have different uptime status

2. **Measuring Downtime**
   - Determining when a system is truly "down" can be complex
   - Degraded performance vs. complete outage
   - Intermittent issues might not qualify as traditional downtime
   - Impact of maintenance windows and planned outages

## Request-Based (Aggregate) Availability

A more practical approach for modern systems is request-based availability:

```math
Availability = Successful Requests / Total Requests
```

### Advantages:
- Directly measures user experience
- Accounts for partial system failures
- Easier to measure and monitor
- Works across distributed systems
- Provides real-time insights

### Limitations:
- Not all requests have equal importance
  - A failed checkout request is more critical than a failed image load
  - Long-running requests vs. quick operations
  - High-priority vs. low-priority operations
- May not capture all types of degradation
  - Slow responses that technically succeed
  - Periodic availability issues
  - Edge cases and rare conditions

## Best Practices for Measuring Availability

To get a complete picture of system availability, consider:

1. **Weighted Request Availability**
   ```
   Availability = (Successful Requests × Weight) / (Total Requests × Weight)
   ```
   Where weight is based on request importance or business impact

2. **Service Level Indicators (SLIs)**
   - Response time thresholds
   - Error rates by request type
   - Regional availability metrics
   - Component-specific availability

3. **Multiple Time Windows**
   - Monthly availability
   - Rolling 30-day window
   - Peak usage periods
   - Business-critical hours



## Minimal cumulative ratio

In summary, count-based (success-ratio) availability metrics:

• are not meaningful in that they are not based on time.
• are biased by highly active users.
• are biased because of different client behavior during
outages.

To make availability information actionable, we want to be able to distinguish between outages of different durations (e.g. one user outage of 1000 minutes, vs 1000 outages of 1 minute). In general, the bigger the window you examine availability over, the better the availability figure looks. To address this, _windowed_ user-uptime combines information from all timescales (window sizes) simultaneously. For a given window size _w_, availability is computed by enumerating all windows of size _w_, computing the availability of each, and then taking the lowest value. Taken together the results are called the _minimal cumulative ratio_ or MCR.

For window size w:

- Enumerate all possible windows of size w
- Compute availability for each window
- Take the lowest (worst) value
